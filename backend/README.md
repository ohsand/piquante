## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm install` then `npm run start` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities such as `nodemon server`. The tests will be hosted on http://localhost:4200/
